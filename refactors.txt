Changes to consider when refactoring:
  - clearer variable names
  - create more classes so that the hotel class isn't doing so much
      - perhaps move checking availability to the reservation class or daterange class?
  - don't allow user to pass in a room_id; assign one to the reservation based on checking availability
  - try to decouple code as much as possible next time
